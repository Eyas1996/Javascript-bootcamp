      Object Challenge
      - The Main Object contains Three Nested Objects.
      - They are the same in every way except that one of them does not contain the game versions.
      - Loop For should only be used to loop elements.
      - All you have to do is solve the instructions and fill in the blanks to reach the desired result.
      - You must not change the structure of the code and all you have to write your code in place of the question marks.
      */
    
    /* Some Info */
    // keys Method return value
    // An array of strings representing the given object's own enumerable   string-keyed property keys.

    // Description
    // Object.keys() returns an array whose elements are strings corresponding to the enumerable string-keyed property names found directly upon object. This is the same as iterating with a for...in loop, except that a for...in loop enumerates properties in the prototype chain as well. The order of the array returned by Object.keys() is the same as that provided by a for...in loop.
    // If you need the property values, use Object.values() instead. If you need both the property keys and values, use Object.entries() instead.

    
    /* hasOwnProperty.... */
    // method returns true if the object has the specified property as own property; false otherwise.
